# Solow Model
	- ## Assumptions
		- *K* is not fixed
		- *L* is not fixed (population growth)
		- *G* = *T* = 0
		- Constant returns to scale
	- ## Definitions
		- Output per worker $= y = \frac{Y}{L}$
		- Capital per worker $= k = \frac{K}{L}$
		- $zY = F(zK, zL), z = \frac{1}{L} \implies y = F(k, 1) = f(k)$
		- Consumption per worker $= c = \frac{C}{L}$
		- Investment per worker $= i = \frac{I}{L}$
		- National income per worker $= y = c + i$ (no *G* or *T*)

	- ## Savings Rate, s
		- #+BEGIN_IMPORTANT
		  $s \neq \frac{S}{L}$
		  #+END_IMPORTANT
		- *s* is an ==exogenous== parameter.
	- ## Consumption Function Per Worker
		- $c = y(1-s)$
	- ## Saving and Investment Functions Per Worker
		- saving per worker $= y - c = sy$ (substituting consumption function per worker)
		- $y= c + i \implies$ investment per worker, $i = y - c = sy$ (savings = investment)
			- $\implies i = s \cdot f(k)$

	- **Capital Accumulation** #formula
		- $\Delta k = i - \delta k = s \cdot f(k) - \delta k$

	- #+BEGIN_NOTE
	  Since ==in the long-run== both sides convert to ==k*==, there is **no growth** in the long-run.
