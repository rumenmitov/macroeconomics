	- the negative relationship between GDP and unemployment
- #+BEGIN_NOTE
  In the ==long-run== prices are **flexible** (firms have time to adjust), in the ==short-run== they are **sticky**.

- # Model of Aggregate Demand and Supply
	- ## Demand
		- From [[Chapter 4 - The Monetary System]]: $M \cdot V = P \cdot Y$
		- An ==increase in prices== causes a decrease in ==real-money balances== ($\frac{M}{P}$), causing==decrease in demand==.
		- {{renderer excalidraw, excalidraw-2024-04-08-08-34-00}}
			- Graph is shifted by ==changes in the money supply (M)==.
				- e.g. M↓, AD←
	- ## Supply
		- From [[Chapter 3 - National Income]]: $Y(const) = F( K(const), L(const) )$
		- #+BEGIN_NOTE
		  Y(const) is the **full-employment**(= natural rate of employment ≠ zero unemployment) or **natural level of output**, at which the economy's resources are fully employed.

		- In the ==long-run== output is determined by ==capital, labor, and technology level==, **not** on the price. Hence, the supply is ==fixed to a certain level==.
		- In the ==short-run==, we assume that sticky prices are ==fixed to a certain price level==.

		- **shocks** #definition
			- exogenous changes in aggregate supply or demand
			- temporarily ==push economy away from equilibrium==
			- alters production costs and affects the prices that firms charge (==price shocks==)
