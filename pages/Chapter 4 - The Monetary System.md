- **money** #definition
	- the stock of assets that can be readily used to make transactions
	- store of value (transfer purchasing power to future)
	- unit of account (everyone uses it to measure value)
- # Types of Money
	- **commodity money** #definition
		- has intrinsic value
		- e.g. gold, wheat, etc.
	- **fiat money** #definition
		- has no intrinsic value
		- e.g. paper currency issued by government
	- #+BEGIN_NOTE
	  Credit cards and checks are not money, they are just the borrowing of funds from the bank. 
	  #+END_NOTE
	- **M1** #definition
		- type of money supply that includes currency and deposits
		- cannot be controlled by the *central bank*
- **money supply, M** #definition #formula
	- the quantity of money available on the market
	- M = C + D
		- *C* is the currency
		- *D* is the deposits
- **monetary policy** #definition
	- control over *money supply*
- **money demand** #definition
	- how much money households want to hold
- **central bank** #definition
	- controls *monetary policy*
- **open-market operations** #definition
	- the purchase and sale of government bonds to control *money supply*
- # Banking
	- **reserves (R)** #definition
		- the portion of deposits that banks have not lent out
	- **100-percent-reserve banking** #definition
		- a system in which banks hold all deposits as reserves
	- **fractional-reserve banking** #definition
		- a system in which banks hold a fraction of their deposits as reserves
	- ## Scenario 1: No Banks
		- D = 0 (i.e. no deposits)
		- M = C remains constant
	- ## Scenario 2: 100-percent Reserve Banking
		- C = 0
		-
		- Money supply remains *constant*
	- ## Scenario 3: Fractional-Reserve Banking
		- Keeps certain percentage of deposits as reserves, loans out rest
		- Money supply is *increased* as banks give out loans
		- **total money supply of fractional-reserve banking** #definition
			- total money supply = $\frac{1}{rr} \times D_0$
				- *rr* is the ratio of reserves to deposits
				- $D_0$ is the initial deposit
		- #+BEGIN_NOTE
		  Banks create money, *not wealth*! They just change the ownership of wealth.
		  #+END_NOTE
	- **bank capital** #definition #formula
		- the resources a bank's owners have put into the bank
		- bank capital = bank assets - bank liabilities
	- **leverage** #definition
		- the use of borrowed money to supplement existing funds for purposes of investment
	- **levervage ration** #formula
		- $\text{leverage ratio} = \frac{\text{assets}}{\text{capital}}$
		- higher ratio $\rightarrow$ more profitable $\rightarrow$ higher risk if a bank run happens
	- **capital requirement** #definition
		- minimum amount of capital mandated by regulators
		- intended to ensure that banks will be able to pay off depositors
		- higher for banks that hold more risky assets
- # Model of Money Supply
	- #+BEGIN_IMPORTANT
	  $M = \frac{cr + 1}{cr + rr} \cdot B$
	  #+END_IMPORTANT
	- **monetary base, B** #definition #formula
		- amount of money issued by the *central bank*
		- B = C + R
			- *C* is the currency (money held by public)
			- *R* is the reserves (money held by banks)
	- **reserve-deposit ratio** #formula
		- $rr = \frac{R}{D}$
			- *R* is the reserves
			- *D* is the deposits
		- depends on regulations and bank policies
	- **currency-deposit ratio, cr** #formula
		- $cr = \frac{C}{D}$
			- *C* is the currency
			- *D* is the deposits
	- **money multiplier, m** #formula
		- the increase in the money supply from a one-dollar increase in the *monetary base*
		- this happens when the bank lends the money you put in to other people
		- $m = \frac{C+D}{B}$
		- will be larger than 1, because rr < 1
		- M = m \times B
		- Central banks control B, but not m
	- TODO \Delta cr impacts on m and M
- # Instruments of Monetary Policy
	- *Open-market operations*
	- **discount rate** #definition
		- the interest rate the *central bank* charges on loan on banks
		- #+BEGIN_NOTE
		  To ==increase the monetary base==, discount rate could be lowered, encouraging banks to ==loan more==.
		  #+END_NOTE
		- **reserve requirements** #definition
			- regulates the minimum reserve-deposit ratio of banks
