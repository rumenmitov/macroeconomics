# Keynesian Cross
	- **planned expenditure, PE** #formula
		- $PE = C + I + G = C( Y - T(const) ) + I(const) + G(const)$
			- *I* is the planned investment
	- **actual expenditure, Y** #formula
		- Y = real GDP
	- ## Assumptions
		- G and T are fixed
		- I is exogenous and fixed
	- ==Equilibrium:== PE = Y

	- #+BEGIN_IMPORTANT
	  When **planned expenditure** is shifted (e.g. higher government spending), then $\Delta Y > \Delta G$ (if we are sticking with the government example). This is because higher government spending creates more jobs, thus increasing the disposable income of households and their respective ==demand==.

	- ## Keynesian Multiplier
		- $\Delta Y = \Delta C + \Delta I + \Delta G, \Delta I = 0$ (I is fixed)
		- $\implies \Delta Y = (MPC \times \Delta Y) + \Delta G$, as T is fixed
		- $\Delta Y = \frac{\Delta G}{1 - MPC}$ #formula
		- Keynesian Multiplier = $\frac{1}{1 - MPC}$ #formula
			- It is ==always greater than 1==, since ==MPC < 1==.
