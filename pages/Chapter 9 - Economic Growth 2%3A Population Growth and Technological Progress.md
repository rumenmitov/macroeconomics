- **rate of population growth, n** #formula
	- $n = \frac{\Delta L}{L}$
- **break-even investment** #formula
	- $i = 0 = (\delta + n) \cdot k$
		- $\delta k$ investment to replace capital as it wears down
		- $nk$ investment to equip new workers
- **change in capital per worker (with population change)** #formula
	- $\Delta k = s \cdot f(k) - (\delta + n) \cdot k$

- # Efficiency
	- $g = \frac{\Delta E}{E}$
		- *E* is the efficiency
