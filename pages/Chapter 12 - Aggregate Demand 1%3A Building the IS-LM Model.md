# Keynesian Cross
	- **planned expenditure, PE** #formula
		- $PE = C + I + G = MPC \times ( \Delta Y - \Delta T) + I(const) + G(const)$
			- *I* is the planned investment
	- **actual expenditure, Y** #formula
		- Y = real GDP
	- ## Assumptions
		- G and T are fixed
		- I is exogenous and fixed
	- ==Equilibrium:== PE = Y

	- #+BEGIN_IMPORTANT
	  When **planned expenditure** is shifted (e.g. higher government spending), then $\Delta Y > \Delta G$ (if we are sticking with the government example). This is because higher government spending creates more jobs, thus increasing the disposable income of households and their respective ==demand==.
	  #+END_IMPORTANT
	- ## Keynesian Multiplier
		- ### Government Spending Increases
			- $\Delta Y = \Delta C + \Delta I + \Delta G, \Delta I = 0$ (I is fixed)
			- $\implies \Delta Y = (MPC \times \Delta Y) + \Delta G$, as T is fixed
			- $\Delta Y = \frac{\Delta G}{1 - MPC}$ #formula
			- Keynesian Multiplier = $\frac{1}{1 - MPC}$ #formula
				- It is ==always greater than 1==, since ==MPC < 1==.
		- ### Decrease in Taxation
			- $\Delta Y = MPC \times (\Delta Y - \Delta T) + \Delta I + \Delta G$
				- only $\Delta T \neq 0 , \Delta Y \neq 0$
			- $\Delta Y (1 - MPC) = -MPC \times \Delta T$
			- $\Delta Y =\frac{-MPC}{1-MPC} \times \Delta T$ #formula
			- #+BEGIN_NOTE
			  This multiplier does not have to be greater than one.

- # Investment-Savings (IS) Curve
	- $Y = C(Y - T_{const}) + I(r) + G$ #formula
	- {{renderer excalidraw, excalidraw-2024-04-22-12-47-00}}
	- IS curve says that ==the lower the interest rate, the higher the income==.
	- #+BEGIN_NOTE
	  When the ==planned expenditure curve== is shifted, there is a corresponding shift in the ==IS curve==. The shift is in the ==IS curve== is equal to the ==Keynesian Multiplier== of the variable we are changing.
	  #+END_NOTE
	- #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
	  If we are increasing G, then PE increase by the same amount as G==, and horizontal shift of the IS curve is $\Delta Y = \frac{\Delta G}{1 - MPC}$.
