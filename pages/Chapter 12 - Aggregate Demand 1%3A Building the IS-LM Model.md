# Keynesian Cross
	- **planned expenditure, PE** #formula
		- $PE = C + I + G = C( Y - T(const) ) + I(const) + G(const)$
			- *I* is the planned investment
	- **actual expenditure, Y** #formula
		- Y = real GDP
	- ## Assumptions
		- G and T are fixed
		- I is exogenous and fixed
	- ==Equilibrium:== PE = Y
