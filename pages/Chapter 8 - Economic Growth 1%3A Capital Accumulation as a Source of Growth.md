# Solow Model
	- ## Assumptions
		- *K* is not fixed
		- *L* is not fixed (population growth)
		- *G* = *T* = 0
		- Constant returns to scale
	- ## Definitions
		- Output per worker $= y = \frac{Y}{L}$
		- Capital per worker $= k = \frac{K}{L}$
		- $zY = F(zK, zL), z = \frac{1}{L} \implies y = F(k, 1) = f(k)$
		- Consumption per worker $= c = \frac{C}{L}$
		- Investment per worker $= i = \frac{}
