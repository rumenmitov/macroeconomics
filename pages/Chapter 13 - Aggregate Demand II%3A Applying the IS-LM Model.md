- # Deriving the AD Curve
	- From the ==LM Curve== we can notice that the *price level* negatively correlates to *income*. If we graph this relationship we get the ==aggregate-demand curve==.
	- {{renderer excalidraw, excalidraw-2024-05-06-10-58-54}}
	- The AD Curve is shifted when there is a shift in anything ==except the price level==.

- # Pigou Effect
	- **pigou effect** #definition
		- \downarrow P \implies \uparrow Y, hence wealth increases
		- when people have ==more wealth== they tend to ==consume more== (\uparrow C)
		- ==IS shifts right==
- # The Debt-Deflation Hypothesis
	- **Debt-Deflation Hypothesis** #definition
		- Prices fall suddenly, ==lower income==, *real debt* rises
		- Wealth is transferred to ==creditors==
		- Since ==creditors== are more frugal, ==overall consumption declines==
