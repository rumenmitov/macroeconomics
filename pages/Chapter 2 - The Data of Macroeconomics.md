- **gross domestic product (GDP)** #definition
	- total expenditure on domestically produced *final* goods and services
	- total income earned by domestically located factors of production
	- NOTE: income = expenditure $\implies$ dollar spent by buyer is income to consumer
	- NOTE: scarcity is not measured in GDP

- # GDP
	- **value added** #formula
		- $\text{value added} = \text{value of output} - \text{value of input goods}$
		- NOTE: Input goods can only be goods! Labor is not included.
		- NOTE: $\text{value of output} = \text{revenue}$
	- **GDP** #formula
		- total output
		- $\Sigma$ value added of each step in production of output
		- total expenditure
		- total income
	- **GDP identity** #formula
	- $Y = C + I + G + NX$,
		- *Y* = value of total output (GDP)
		- *C* = consumption
		- *I* = investments
		- *G* = government spending
		- *NX* = net exports
	- **consumption** #definition
		- the value of all goods and services brought by households
		- *durable goods*
		- *non-durable goods*
		- *services*
	- **investments** #definition
		- spending on capital, a physical asset used in future production
		- #+BEGIN_PINNED
		  Capital is a *stock* variable and investment is a *flow* variable.
		  #+END_PINNED
		- *business fixed investment* (i.e. equipment)
		- *residential fixed investment* (i.e. housing units)
		- *inventory investment* (i.e. the change in the value of all firms' inventories)
	- **government spending (consumption)** #definition
		- government spending *only* on goods and services
		- NOTE: Does not include *transfer payments* (e.g. unemployment insurance payments)
	- **net exports** #definition #formula
		- *exports* is the value of goods and services sold to other countries
		- *imports* is the value of goods and services purchased from other countries
		- $\text{net exports} = \text{exports} - \text{imports}$
		- #+BEGIN_PINNED
		  *Trade deficit* (i.e. net exports < 0) does not reduce GDP, because the imports are subtracted from domestic spending.
		  #+END_PINNED
	- **Gross National Product (GNP)** #definition
		- total income generated by nation's factors of production, regardless of where they are located
	- **nominal GDP** #definition #formula
		- measures GDP in *current prices*
		- $\text{nominal GDP} = \Sigma P_{product} \times Q_{product}$
		- #+BEGIN_NOTE
		  Changes to *nominal GDP* can be due to *prices* and *output*.
		  #+END_NOTE
	- **real GDP** #definition
		- measures GDP using the prices of a *base year*
		- **Paasche Index** #formula
			- $\text{GDP} = \frac{\Sigma P_{\text{current year}} \times Q_{\text{current year}}}{\Sigma P_{\text{base year}} \times Q_{\text{current year}}} \times 100$
		- **Laspayers Index** #formula
			- $\text{GDP} = \frac{\Sigma P_{\text{current year}} \times Q_{\text{base year}}}{\Sigma P_{\text{base year}} \times Q_{\text{base year}}} \times 100$
		- #+BEGIN_NOTE
		  Changes to *real GDP* can only be due to *output*.
		  #+END_NOTE
- # Inflation
	- **inflation rate** #definition
		- the percentage change in the overall levels of prices
	- ## Measures of Inflation
		- ### GDP Deflator
			- **GDP deflator** #definition #formula
				- measures *inflation rate*
				- $\text{GDP deflator} = \frac{\text{nominal GDP}}{\text{real GDP}} \times 100$
				- *GDP deflator* can be viewed as the ==weighted average of prices==, with the weight of a price being the corresponding quantity over the real GDP: 
				  
				  $\frac{Q}{\text{real GDP}} \times P$
			- #+BEGIN_IMPORTANT
			  Consider: P \times Q, and P rises by *x%* and Q by *y%*, the P \times Q has risen by ==(x + y)%==.
			  This also works for *division* using subtraction.
			  #+END_IMPORTANT
			- **chain-weighted GDP** #definition
				- using the last year as a *base year* when calculating *real GDP* for higher accuracy
		- ###  Consumer Price Index (CPI)
			- **consumer price index (CPI)** #definition
				- measures overall change in consumer prices for average household
				- **Paasche Index** #formula
					- $\text{CPI} = \frac{\Sigma P_{\text{current year}} \times Q_{\text{current year}}}{\Sigma P_{\text{base year}} \times Q_{\text{current year}}} \times 100$
				- **Laspayers Index** #formula
					- $\text{CPI} = \frac{\Sigma P_{\text{current year}} \times Q_{\text{base year}}}{\Sigma P_{\text{base year}} \times Q_{\text{base year}}} \times 100$
				- #+BEGIN_IMPORTANT
				  Quantity is ==fixed==!
				  #+END_IMPORTANT
				- *CPI* (like the *GDP deflator*) is a ==weighted average of prices==:
				  
				  $\frac{Q}{\text{cost of basket (base year)}} \times P$
				  
				  Unlike the *GDP deflator*, ==weights remain fixed over time==.
			- #### Disadvantages of CPI
				- **substitution bias**
					- CPI used *fixed weights* so it cannot account for *substitution* of cheaper goods
				- **introduction to new goods**
					- because of the *fixed weights* CPI cannot account for new goods on the market
				- **unmeasured changes in quality**
					- improvements in goods (i.e. better value for dollar) is not accounted for
		- ### GDP Deflator VS CPI
			- Price of *capital goods* (i.e. investments)
				- GDP deflator $\rightarrow$ includes
				- CPI $\rightarrow$ excludes
			- Prices of imported consumer goods
				- GDP deflator $\rightarrow$ excludes
				- CPI $\rightarrow$ includes
			- Basket of goods
				- GDP deflator $\rightarrow$ changes per year
				- CPI $\rightarrow$ fixed
- # Labor
	- **employed** #definition
		- working at a paid job
	- **unemployed** #definition
		- not employed *but* looking for a job
	- **labor force** #formula
		- labor force = employed + unemployed
	- **not in the labor force** #definition
		- not employed and not looking for work
	- **unemployment rate** #formula
		- unemployment rate = $\frac{\text{employed}}{\text{labor force}} \times 100$
	- **labor-force participation rate** #formula
		- labor-force participation rate = $\frac{\text{labor force}}{\text{adult population}} \times 100$
