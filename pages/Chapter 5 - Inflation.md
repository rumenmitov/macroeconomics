- **velocity** #definition #formula
	- how often money changes hands
	- $V = \frac{T}{M}$
		- *V* is the velocity
		- *T* is the value of all transactions
		- *M* is the money supply
	- $V = \frac{P \times Y}{M}$
		- Using nominal GDP for *total transactions*
		- *P* is the price output (GDP deflator)
		- *Y* is the quantity of output (real GDP)
- **quantity equation** #formula
	- M \times V = P \times Y
- **real money balances** #definition #formula
	- purchasing power of money supply
	- real money balance = $\frac{M}{P}$

	- the demand to hold currency as opposed to keeping money in deposits
	- $(\frac{M}{P})^d = k \cdot Y$
	- #+BEGIN_NOTE
	  *d* ==is not a number==! It just means demand.
	  #+END_NOTE
	- *k* is an exogenous parameter and it represents ==how much people wish to hold for each dollar of income==
	- $k = \frac{1}{V}$
- #+BEGIN_NOTE
  When people hold lots of money relative to incomes (k is large), money changes hand infrequently (velocity, V, is small).

- # Quantity Theory of Money
	- ## Assumptions
		- V is constant and exogenous
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	- **price level** #formula
		- $P = \frac{\text{nominal GDP}}{\text{real GDP}}$
	- **quantity equation in growth rates** #formula
		- $\frac{\Delta M}{M} + \frac{\Delta V}{V} = \frac{\Delta P}{P} + \frac{\Delta Y}{Y}$
		- #+BEGIN_NOTE
		  *V* is constant so: $\frac{\Delta V}{V} = 0$.

	- **inflation rate** #formula
		- $\pi = \frac{\Delta P}{P} = \frac{\Delta M}{M} - \frac{\Delta Y}{Y}$
			- \pi is the inflation rate
	- **seigniorage** #definition
		- creation of money withour raising taxes or selling bonds
	- **inflation tax** #definition
		- money creation to raise revenue can cause inflation, paid by holders of money and other nominal assets
	- **Fisher Equation (Ex Post)** #formula
		- $r = i - \pi$
			- *r* is the real interest rate
			- *i* is the nominal interest rate (not adjusted for inflation)
	- **Fisher Effect** #definition
		- increase in inflation cause equal increase in real interest rate
	- **Fisher Equation (Ex Ante)** #formula
		- $r= i - E \cdot \pi$
			- E \cdot \pi expected interest rate
	- #+BEGIN_NOTE
	  Money demand depends negatively on the *nominal interest rate*, because it could be invested into interest-bearing assets.
	  #+END_NOTE
	- **Liquidity Function** #definition
		- $(\frac{M}{P})^d = L(i, Y)$
			- *L* is liquidity
			- $i = r + E \cdot \pi$
			- #+BEGIN_NOTE
			  *M* depends ==negatively== on *i*, and ==positively== to *Y*.
			  #+END_NOTE
	- **Equilibrium** #definition
		- $\frac{M}{P} = L(r + E \cdot \pi, Y)$
		- #+BEGIN_NOTE
		  In the long run:
		  - *M* is exogenous
		  - *r* adjusts to S = I
		  - *P* adjusts to ensure that $Y_{const} = F(K_{const}, L_{const})$

	- ## Unexpected Inflation
- **hyperinflation** #definition
	- $\pi \geq 50%$ per month
	- caused by excessive money supply growth

	- measured in money units
- **Classsical Dichotemy** #definition
	- theoretical separation of *real* and *nominal* variables implies that nominal variables ==do not affect== real variables
