- **net exports** #formula
	- $NX = X - IM = Y - (C + I + G)$
		- *X* are the exports
		- *IM* are the imports
- **trade surplus** #definition
	- exports are greater than imports
	- size of *trade surplus* = NX
- **trade deficit** #definition
	- imports are greater than exports
	- size of *trade deficit* = -NX
- **net capital outflow** #definition #formula
	- net outflow of ==loanable funds==
	- net capital outflow = S - I
		- *S* is the national savings
		- *I* is the investment
	- S > I $\implies$ country is a ==net lender==
	- S < I $\implies$ country is a ==net borrower==
	- #+BEGIN_NOTE
	  NX = (Y - C - G) - I = S - I
	  $\implies$ ==net exports = net capital outflow==
	  #+END_NOTE
- # Assumptions
	- Domestic and foreign bonds are perfect substitutes
	- **Perfect capital mobility** - no restrictions on international trade in assets
	- Economy is small (does not affect global interest rate, denoted r*)
