	- average rate of unemployment
- **workers in labor force, L** #formula
	- L = E + U
		- *E* is employed
		- *U* is unemployed
- **unemployment rate** #formula
	- unemployment rate = $\frac{U}{L}$
- **rate of job separation, s** #definition
	- fraction of employed workers that lose their jobs
- **rate of job finding, f** #definition
	- fraction of unemployed workers who find jobs

  We take *L*, *s* and *f* as exogenous.

- **steady-state** #definition #formula
	- when the ==inflows = outflows==, i.e. *unemployment rate* is constant
	- s \times E = f \times U
