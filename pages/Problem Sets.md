	- ## Chapter 1
		- Macroeconomics deals with the economy on an aggregate level, while microeconomics focuses on single markets. They are related in that they both depend on the market clearing model.
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- Economists build models to simplify the world so that they can test potential policies.
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- A market-clearing model means that the market operates at an equilibrium. Markets clear in the long run.
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- Macroeconomic issues: 
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- Energy crisis due to Russian invasion of Ukraine
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- Supply chain issues in the Red Sea
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- Inflation during Covid
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- I think the defining characteristic of a science is the ability to conduct unbiased and reproduce-able experiments that reveal an objective truth. I do not think macroeconomics can be considered a science as it is hard to reproduce effects of policies.

		- $Q_{D(\text{ice cream})} = D(P_{\text{ice cream}}, I)$, where *I* is the monthly income of the consumer.
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		  
		  $P_{\text{ice cream}} = 1 + P_{\text{yogurt}}$
		  
		  $Q_{D(\text{ice cream})} = \frac{I}{1000} - P_{\text{yogurt}}$
		  
		  When the price of yogurt decreases, so will the price of ice cream. Hence demand for ice cream will increase.
		- Prices of haircuts changes rarely. Hence, the price is sticky.

	- ## Chapter 2
		- GDP measures total expenditure on domestic goods and services and total domestic income. Essentially expenditure is the same as income, because whatever the buyer pays for is income for the producer.
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- Four components of GDP:
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- Consumption e.g. services
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- Investments e.g. residential investments
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- Government spending e.g. infrastructure
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- Net exports e.g. EU exporting steel

		      nominal GDP(2010) = 200*2 + 200*3 = 1000
		      nominal GDP(2020) = 250*4 + 500*4 = 3000
		      real GDP(2020) = 250*2 + 500*3 = 2000
		      GDP deflator = 3000 / 2000 = 1.5
		      CPI(2020) = Lapayers(not mentioned) = 1.6
		- Farmer adds $1. Miller adds $2. Baker adds $3. Total GDP of the bread is $6.
