- **gross domestic product (GDP)** #definition
	- total expenditure on domestically produced *final* goods and services
	- total income earned by domestically located factors of production
	- NOTE: income = expenditure $\implies$ dollar spent by buyer is income to consumer
	- NOTE: scarcity is not measured in GDP

- # GDP
	- **value added** #formula
		- $\text{value added} = \text{value of output} - \text{value of input goods}$
		- NOTE: Input goods can only be goods! Labor is not included.
		- NOTE: $\text{value of output} = \text{revenue}$
	- **GDP** #formula
		- GDP = final value of output = $\Sigma$ value added of each step in production of output = expenditure of consumer for output
	- **GDP identity** #formula
	- $Y = C + I + G + NX$,
		- *Y* = value of total output (GDP)
		- *C* = consumption
		- *I* = investments
		- *G* = government spending
		- *NX* = net exports
	- **consumption** #definition
		- the value of all goods and services brought by households
		- *durable goods*
		- *non-durable goods*
		- *services*
	- **investments** #definition
		- spending on capital, a physical asset used in future production
		- *business fixed investment* (i.e. equipment)
		- *residential fixed investment* (i.e. housing units)
		- *inventory investment* (i.e. the change in the value of all firms' inventories)
	- **government spending (consumption)** #definition
		- government spending *only* on goods and services
		- NOTE: Does not include *transfer payments* (e.g. unemployment insurance payments)
	- **net exports** #definition #formula
		- *exports* is the value of goods and services sold to other countries
		- *imports* is the value of goods and services purchased from other countries
		- $\text{net exports} = \text{exports} - \text{imports}$
		- #+BEGIN_PINNED
		  *Trade deficit* (i.e. net exports < 0) does not reduce GDP, because the imports are subtracted from domestic spending.

	- **GDP deflator** #formula
		- $\text{inflation} = \frac{\Sigma P_{\text{current year}} \times Q_{\text{average consumer basket}}}{\Sigma P_{\text{year of comparison}} \times Q_{\text{average consumer basket}}}$
- #  Consumer Price Index (CPI)
	- **consumer price index (CPI)** #definition
		- measures overall change in consumer prices
	- **Paasche Index** #formula
		- $\text{CPI} = \frac{P_{\text{current year}} \times Q_{\text{average consumer basket (current year)}}}{P_{\text{year of comparison}} \times Q_{\text{average consumer basket (current year)}}}$
