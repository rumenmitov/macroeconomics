- **natural rate of unemployment** #definition
	- average rate of unemployment
- **workers in labor force, L** #formula
	- L = E + U
		- *E* is employed
		- *U* is unemployed
- **unemployment rate** #formula
	- unemployment rate = $\frac{U}{L}$
- **rate of job separation, s** #definition
	- fraction of employed workers that lose their jobs
- **rate of job finding, f** #definition
	- fraction of unemployed workers who find jobs
- #+BEGIN_NOTE
  We take *L*, *s* and *f* as exogenous.
  #+END_NOTE
- **steady-state** #definition #formula
	- when the ==inflows = outflows==, i.e. *unemployment rate* is constant
	- s \times E = f \times U
	- $\implies \frac{U}{L} = \frac{s}{s + f}$ (by applying the formulae from above)
- **frictional unemployment** #definition
	- caused by the time it takes workers to search for a job
- **sectoral shifts** #definition
	- changes in the composition of demand among industries or regions
