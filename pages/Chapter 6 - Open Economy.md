- **net exports** #formula

		- *X* are the exports

- **trade surplus** #definition

- **net capital outflow** #definition #formula
	- net outflow of ==loanable funds==
	- net capital outflow = S - I
		- *S* is the national savings = Y - C - G
		- *I* is the investment
	- S > I $\implies$ country is a ==net lender==

- # Assumptions
	- Domestic and foreign bonds are perfect substitutes
	- **Perfect capital mobility** - no restrictions on international trade in assets
	- Economy is small (does not affect global interest rate, denoted r*)
- Bases on those assumptions ==r = r*==

- # Currency Exchange
	- **nominal exchange rate, e** #definition
		- the relative price of domestic currency in terms of foreign currency
	- **real exchange rate, ε** #definition
		- the relative price of domestic goods in terms of foreign goods
		- $ε = \frac{e \times P}{P*}$
			- *P* is the currency A per good A
			- *P** is the currency B per good B
			- if ε increases goods A become more expensive, so:
				- exports fall and imports fall $\implies$ net exports fall
	- {{renderer excalidraw, excalidraw-2024-04-01-16-30-11}}
		- Demand is the ==need for currency A to buy goods A==
		- Supply (net exports = net capital outflow) is the ==amount of currency A available to be invested abroad==
	- **purchasing-power parity** #definition
		- exact same goods must sell at the same price in all countries
		- ε = 1 $\implies$ e = $\frac{P*}{P}$
